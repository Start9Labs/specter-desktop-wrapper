# Connecting to the Bitcoin Network

Specter can be configured to connect to the bitcoin network via Bitcoin Core - this is the default option and is the least demanding on your server. This is the correct choice if you are running a Server Lite. However it will be very slow to rescan after adding a new wallet. Electrs can be used instead which will be far faster, but is not advisible if you are running less powerful hardware, or pruning in Bitcoin Core.

# Using your local Mempool service as a block explorer

If you'd like to use your own Mempool to open links in Specter head to "Settings" -> "Block Explorer URL" and input either the .local or .onion address of your Mempool service.
